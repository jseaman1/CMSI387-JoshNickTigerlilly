'touch' mod ~ add user feedback and '-test' switch to the 'touch' command

Very nice work on this deliverable!  You've hit all the requirements.  I do
notice that you have the three existing commands in your "command line
options" section.  This was actually intended to list the options to YOUR
command, which from reading the text should be "-test" as the only one, to
test if the file exists.

I can't wait to see this one in action!
