Nice work!

Thanks for your inputs with regard to machine interaction/communication!  I
will do my best to incorporate concepts about networking and interprocess
communication into the class as the semester rolls on.

Good observation in question 4c about the scale factor making the difference
more obvious!

I like the way you did the Gantt charts with a separate table to summarize
the data.  Very neat and easy to see.

Also, I'm a Gemini....

Excellent work on this assignment!
