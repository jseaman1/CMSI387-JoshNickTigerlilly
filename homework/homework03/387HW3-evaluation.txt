Question 1: dining philosophers program:   19.00 out of 20 possible
Question 2: why immune explanation     :   10.00 out of 10 possible
Question 3: file processing "C" program:   20.00 out of 20 possible
Question 4: mmap program "C" program   :   19.00 out of 20 possible
Question 5: appropriate class explained:   10.00 out of 10 possible

Total possible points:     80.00 points
           your score:     78.00 points
                total:     78.00/80.00 = 97.5% which is an A-plus

Nice work on this one.  Here are a couple of comments:

On your dining philosophers program, it isn't supposed to end.  If there is
no deadlock, it should keep going, like the Energizer Bunny.  However, your
code looks like if it were modified to allow that, it would be fine so you
earn nearly full credit.

For the mmap program, it seems to be working, but I get an error traceback:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "question_4.py", line 18, in <module>
    check_for_x("q4_test/late_success.txt")
  File "question_4.py", line 6, in check_for_x
    with open(filename, mode="r", encoding="utf8") as file_obj:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'q4_test/late_success.txt'

All in all, though, good job!!

SEMESTER SO FAR, COMING UP TO FINAL EXAM:
   homework01:  12/12 = 100.00% of 10 pts = 10.00 pts
   homework02:  97/97 = 100.00% of 10 pts = 10.00 pts
   homework03:  78/80 =  97.50% of 10 pts =  9.75 pts
        total:                              29.75 pts out of 30.00
                        which is  99.17% which is an A-plus

Very good work!!
