Question 1 mutex reversing:          5/ 5 points

Question 2 auditing code change:     5/ 5 points

Question 3 test program:            20/20 points

Question 4 notifyall() addition:    10/10 points

Question 5a 2-phase locking:         5/ 5 points

Question 5b short read locks:        5/ 5 points

Question 5c snapshot isolation:      5/ 5 points

Question 6 virtual address xlate:    5/ 5 points
   You have the virtual and physical backwards, but you have the correct
      values for the calculations, so you earn full credit.  Just swap the
      column headers in your table...  :grin:

Question 7 calc. explanation:        5/ 5 points

Question 8 loop 4096 analysis:      20/20 points
   I wonder if doing this program in Python caused any differences from if
      you had done it in "C" instead.  It would be worth an experiment just
      to see if you can get your operating system to make the virtual memory
      system kick in, which should show you some noticeable difference in
      the time required.  You can use the "C" functions in "time.h" to get
      the system time.

Question 9 fork() tree:             15/15 points

Total 100 out of 100 = 100.00% which is an A-plus
